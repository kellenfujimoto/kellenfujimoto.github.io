      <blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s an everyday war.</p>

<p>—Stephane Vigroux, Parkour Generations</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As traceurs, we strive to overcome obstacles as efficiently as possible. For a time, in the beginning, the going is easy. Sure we&#8217;ll end up sore every night after we train, but it is easy in the moment to push ourselves to do better. All of the basic movements in parkour can be learned in a matter of months, and most of us are self-selected to be kinesthetically intelligent. This is the honeymoon stage in our relationship with the discipline—where we build new skills every day—still feeling out how it’s gonna be between us.</p>

<p>Once we have gained proficiency with those skills, however, a new leg of the journey begins. Kevin Carroll calls this &#8220;the lonely work&#8221;, the work that nobody knows about, but also the work that really makes a difference. To do anything well, you need to have that dedication and passion to train, by your own motivation.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In order to shine in all moments you must prepare. You must do your homework. Preparation means doing what I call the lonely work: the unglamorous tasks that no one tells you to do and the hard work that no one will notice.</p>

<p>—Kevin Carroll, <a href="http://smile.amazon.com/Rules-Red-Rubber-Ball-Sustain/dp/1933060026/ref=smi_www_rco2_go_smi?_encoding=UTF8&*Version*=1&*entries*=0"><em>Rules of the Red Rubber Ball</em></a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>As practitioners of our art we must devote untold hours honing our craft. Doing the lonely work requires a certain mental fortitude to challenge yourself, every day. You train parkour, progressing forward and avoiding stagnation at all costs. To be successful requires commitment, persistence, and patience. Nobody accomplished anything that was easy, and all of the experienced traceurs that we look up to truly dedicated themselves to parkour.</p>

<p>When coaching parkour, we emphasize that this isn&#8217;t meant to be practiced once a week and called good. With this discipline you need to take pride in your work, going that extra mile between mediocre and excellent. I truly believe that an extra 30 minutes a day of training is what makes the difference, over time, between Daniel Ilabaca and the half-assers.</p>

<p>Train hard, train safe, and most importantly train well.</p>
