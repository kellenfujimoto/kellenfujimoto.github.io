        <div class="post-meta">Mon, Jan 1, 0001 <small>~600 words</small></div>

    <p>Only a few decades ago, our social lives were an intimate tapestry woven amongst our friends. Our friends knew everything about us, and we were the same for them. News was actively shared with the people we cared about most; we could keep track of who knew what with a fair amount of accuracy, and the art of conversation was alive and well. We told stories, we mailed newsletters to relatives, we laughed together over a beer.</p>

<p>Personal interactions have given way to indirect communication blasts. Now most of our lives are announced into a void, where individual significance is lost in a sea of status updates. Many lament this loss of intimacy, but there is a more significant change with the coming of the social web.</p>

<p>Privacy has become more of a concern as the older generations begin to adopt social networks such as Facebook and Twitter. The concept of being &ldquo;Googled&rdquo; is frightening in the context of tangible privacy, but is commonly accepted as a fact of life on the internet. It has become nearly impossible to avoid the internet&rsquo;s grasp in the age of Facebook and Google. The currency on the net is information: anything and everything that a company can get their hands on.</p>

<p>The definition of &ldquo;personal information&rdquo; has undergone a massive change in the internet revolution&rsquo;s wake. It is practically impossible to avoid divulging your personal activities to massive net corporations, especially as their techniques are becoming more sophisticated. As an example, anytime you visit a page with Facebook&rsquo;s ubiquitous &ldquo;like&rdquo; button, they now have your activity recorded and are able to <a href="http://www.geek.com/articles/news/facebook-like-button-tracks-you-even-if-you-dont-click-20110519/">track you throughout the net.</a></p>

<p>Personal information is the new currency of the internet. Advertisers want it, and are willing to pay for our services for us if we provide them with a little bit of data. Facebook is making billions of dollars off of advertising, I doubt its users would like to foot the bill. Even as America&rsquo;s economy switches from manufacturing where tangible goods are bought and sold to one where services are exchanged, consumers are unable to wrap their heads around paying for these fantastic services. This is a subject for an entirely separate blog post, but the feeling of &ldquo;free&rdquo; that we get when we pay with our habits instead of our wallets is feeding this delusion.</p>

<p>Perhaps due to &ldquo;growing up with the internet&rdquo;, I don&rsquo;t really care as much about traditional &ldquo;privacy&rdquo; anyway. Yes, I do take my online identity seriously. Yes, I realize that publicly tweeting about being away from home <a href="http://www.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,1964873,00.html">isn&rsquo;t a great idea</a>. Do I guard my real name as if my life depended on it? No!</p>

<p>I believe that living with Integrity in all aspects of life is important, and the internet is no exception. We all walk the line of what to show on our sleeve, but I think I fall further on the side of candor than most. I do avoid placing my family and acquaintances in the line of fire of my personal life, but I&rsquo;m not going to hide it from them either. If they go on a fishing expedition they can take responsibility for what they catch.</p>
