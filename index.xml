      <description>&lt;p&gt;Why proactively inclusive leadership is so important:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;If that’s not actually hate speech, it’s pretty damn close,” Beard said of the Reddit comments. &amp;ldquo;We are not going to walk that line as Mozilla. So if and when we identify who this person is, if they are an employee, they will be fired. And regardless, either way, they are not welcome to continue to participate in the Mozilla project. It is not who we are.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>EMV Concerns — Do They Have Merit?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The upcoming &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EMV&#34; title=&#34;EMV — Wikipedia.org&#34;&gt;EMV&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://blogs.wsj.com/corporate-intelligence/2014/02/06/october-2015-the-end-of-the-swipe-and-sign-credit-card/&#34; title=&#34;The End of the Swipe-and-Sign Credit Card — The Wall Street Journal&#34;&gt;transition&lt;/a&gt; is sowing doubt amongst many a tech pundit. Predictions of consumer confusion and beleaguered merchants abound, but does this fear-mongering hold any water? I&amp;rsquo;m a large proponent of these &amp;ldquo;Chip-and-PIN&amp;rdquo; cards, and the anxiety surrounding them amounts to little more than the usual fear of technological advancement. &lt;a href=&#34;http://glennf.com&#34; title=&#34;Glenn Fleishman&#34;&gt;Glenn Fleishman&lt;/a&gt; recently wrote an article for Fast Company — &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.fastcompany.com/3049641/the-new-chip-equipped-credit-cards-safer-and-for-now-more-confusing &amp;quot;The New Chip-Equipped Credit Cards: Safer, and (for Now&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New Chip-Equipped Credit Cards: Safer, and (for Now) More Confusing&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; More Confusing — Fast Company&amp;rdquo;) — which articulates the criticisms of EMV in light of the impending switch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In spite of Fleishman&amp;rsquo;s hedging parenthetical, he opens the article with unqualified skepticism:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The confusion over what&amp;rsquo;s coming will lead to frustration, merchant liability, and potential lost sales and unexpected fraud after a rule change kicks in October 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, there are several arguments for why EMV would lead to such destructive frustration: PIN requirements lead to infrequent card use, it&amp;rsquo;s unclear when a PIN or signature is required, and consumers will default to swiping their EMV cards. His evidence supporting these arguments are unconvincing, however.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fleishman quotes Julie Conroy, research director at Aite Group, as saying the PIN requirement in Canada would irritate and confuse the American consumer. He cites that problems issuing PINs caused &amp;ldquo;transaction volume [to] dip significantly&amp;rdquo;. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cardhub.com/edu/chip-and-pin-vs-chip-and-signature/&#34; title=&#34;Chip-and-Pin vs. Chip-and-Signature — Cardhub.com&#34;&gt;EMV cards in the US will not be using mandatory PINs&lt;/a&gt;, though. Cards here will follow the same rules as our old magstripe cards: debit cards will require a PIN (in some situations), and credit cards will be Chip-and-Signature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another argument is that, with US cards sometimes requiring a signature, consumers will be confused about whether they need to enter a PIN or sign for purchases. This difference already exists in America&amp;rsquo;s swiped cards, with debit transactions requiring a PIN and credit transactions using a signature. This barrier may have existed with the introduction of debit transactions, but is hardly a distinguishing characteristic between EMV and magstripe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If those bumbling consumers forget the magic chip on their card and try to swipe it on an EMV-compatible reader, they&amp;rsquo;ll be prompted to dip it instead:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A consumer who swipes a chipped credit card in a reader that&amp;rsquo;s equipped with an EMV reader should be prompted to dip the card instead. This should keep the merchant from bearing excess risk due to someone swiping instead of dipping. If the card has a PIN—whether from one of the few U.S. bank which require it, a debit card, or an international traveler from a chip-and-PIN region—the consumer is prompted to enter the PIN.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sounds less confusing than some card readers I have to use today, and on par with the more intuitive ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fleishman is also concerned with the liability shift&amp;rsquo;s impact on merchants:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…research shows that only 59% of retail locations will be ready to go with chip readers by the end of 2016. That leaves millions with just old-fashioned swipe readers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, consumers shouldn&amp;rsquo;t worry about merchant concerns such as this. Yes, consumers with EMV cards will be more vulnerable to fraud, but are not held liable for losses due to it. Additionally, with &lt;a href=&#34;https://squareup.com/emv-liability-shift&#34; title=&#34;EMV Card Reader — Square&#34;&gt;Square&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.paypal.com/webapps/mpp/emv&#34; title=&#34;EMV Card Reader — PayPal&#34;&gt;PayPal&lt;/a&gt; coming out with EMV readers, the champions of small business transactions should help alleviate this issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Change is scary, but the massive benefits of EMV and (eventually) NFC vastly outweigh the relatively mild disadvantages. Merchants will need to work on updating their POS terminals to accept the new payment methods, but the transition is gathering steam with support for businesses of all shapes and sizes. Not only is this upgrade inevitable, its challenges have already been tackled the world over. America&amp;rsquo;s credit card infrastructure may have been hobbling along for awhile, but the burgeoning growth of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.apple.com/apple-pay/&#34; title=&#34;Apple Pay — Apple.com&#34;&gt;high-tech payments&lt;/a&gt; is signaling that the country is ready for an upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Even more impressive, 7.5 billion page views:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a dev found a solution just half of those times, and it saved them just 30 minutes, that&amp;rsquo;s nearly 1.85 &lt;em&gt;billion&lt;/em&gt; hours saved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What a mind blowingly helpful resource for developers around the globe.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Weather App Update</title>
      <link>http://kellenfujimoto.com/2015/08/weather-app-update/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 17 Aug 2015 09:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Given Seattle&amp;rsquo;s recent spat of rain, it&amp;rsquo;s high time for a weather app update. In my previous post, I recommended Dark Sky over Yahoo! Weather and Solar. Since then, a bunch of new apps have entered the space, some deserving of attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;dark-sky-a-precipitous-fall:798d06a5ccf2f0977ccfe820840fb136&#34;&gt;Dark Sky: a precipitous fall&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Dark Sky: &lt;a href=&#34;https://appsto.re/us/nhD1E.i&#34;&gt;$4 in the iOS App Store&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://kellenfujimoto.com/img/dark-sky.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Dark Sky&#39;s new launch screen&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I loved the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.google.com/search?q=dark+sky&amp;amp;amp;client=safari&amp;amp;amp;hl=en-us&amp;amp;amp;prmd=iv&amp;amp;amp;source=lnms&amp;amp;amp;tbm=isch&amp;amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;amp;ved=0CAYQ_AUoAWoVChMIu7CT-J-sxwIVAyuICh05BgS5&amp;amp;amp;biw=414&amp;amp;amp;bih=628#hl=en-us&amp;amp;amp;tbm=isch&amp;amp;amp;q=dark+sky+ios&amp;amp;amp;imgrc=tKnXumassBG0rM%3A&#34;&gt;old Dark Sky interface&lt;/a&gt;. It was clean and efficient. Unfortunately, they veered off into &amp;ldquo;playing with fire&amp;rdquo; levels of UI experimentation. Jackadam has shoved a weather timeline into a thermometer metaphor, poisoning what was a professionally focused interface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, they have followed this skeumorphic rabbit hole into the week view. Previously, tapping these little lasagnes would make rain portions of the forecast blue, indicating if there was going to be rain for the rest of the day. This didn&amp;rsquo;t alter the layout, it just revealed more detail. The current version shoves their fancy new thermometer under the tapped day, managing to replace useful information with a confusing new display.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s probably no surprise that I don&amp;rsquo;t use Dark Sky as my weather app anymore. I &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; use it for rain notifications: they still send a push notification when rain is predicted for your area. A new feature allows you to set custom notifications for precipitation chance, forecasted temperature, etc., so you know whether to bring shorts or a rain coat to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;check-the-weather-elegant-utility:798d06a5ccf2f0977ccfe820840fb136&#34;&gt;Check the Weather: elegant utility&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Check the Weather: &lt;a href=&#34;https://appsto.re/us/3phqH.i&#34;&gt;$3 in the iOS App Store&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://kellenfujimoto.com/img/check-the-weather.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Check the Weather makes checking the basics easy and pleasant&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check the Weather manages to pack a lot of information into a relatively clean interface. It has Dark Sky integration, and a nice big indication for temperature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I had one nitpick, it&amp;rsquo;s that the hourly view (easy to get to by swiping right) is displayed textually instead of visually. As John Siracusa &lt;a href=&#34;http://5by5.tv/hypercritical/19&#34;&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;, &amp;ldquo;don&amp;rsquo;t make me read.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though it isn&amp;rsquo;t my regular weather app, Check the Weather is a great take on a traditional weather app, with handy information at your fingertips.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;weather-line-they-figured-it-out:798d06a5ccf2f0977ccfe820840fb136&#34;&gt;Weather Line: they figured it out&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Weather Line: &lt;a href=&#34;https://appsto.re/us/NBUOQ.i&#34;&gt;$3 in the iOS App Store&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://kellenfujimoto.com/img/weather-line.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Scrolling through the weather line is as fun as it is informative&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I use Weather Line every day. It visually shows what the forecast is for the rest of the day: blue line? It&amp;rsquo;ll be rainy. Going up? It&amp;rsquo;ll be hotter. There is also a small info panel that will show the details of any hour you tap on. The metaphor spans the hour, day, and month views, and looks great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Weather Line also integrates Dark Sky, for precipitation volume:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-you-should-get:798d06a5ccf2f0977ccfe820840fb136&#34;&gt;What you should get&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dark Sky&amp;rsquo;s weather alerts and Weather Line&amp;rsquo;s intuitive interface are a fantastic one-two combo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I had to pick just one, I&amp;rsquo;d suggest Dark Sky — plot twist! Their proactive alerts are a lifesaver, especially if you normally don&amp;rsquo;t think about the forecast before heading out for the day. Especially if you live in a place where it can go from 89° to rain all day during the course of a week, it helps to have the worry taken care of for you.&lt;/p&gt;
