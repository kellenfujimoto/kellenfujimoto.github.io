<p>Those of us who are white have a remarkable capacity for delusions. A majority of whites have said in opinion polls that blacks earn as much as whites and are as healthy as whites. In fact, black median household income is $34,598, compared with $58,270 for non-Hispanic whites, according to census data. Black life expectancy is four years shorter than that of whites.&rdquo;</p>

That LGBTQ people, people of color, and, yes, women are all vulnerable to those things—and have to deal with a pile of other issues as well.</p>

<p>The journey of understanding intersectionality begins with a single realization of one&rsquo;s privilege.

<p>In each of these instances there was an act of state violence which has literally led to the deaths of hundreds of thousands of civilians and lifelong physical and emotional scars for those who were &ldquo;merely tortured&rdquo; or willingly served our country.</p>

That social order is fairly simple: there are the whites who can do whatever they want, then there are the &ldquo;criminals&rdquo; and the &ldquo;minorities&rdquo; and the &ldquo;gays&rdquo;, except those that act like the white people. The system exists to contain the teeming masses of minorities/criminals and to keep them in check. If a black man is killed by a police officer, well that&rsquo;s his fault.</p>

<p>Gideon goes on to describe the police as a &ldquo;private security force&rdquo;. He couldn&rsquo;t be more accurate. With this case it is ever more obvious that they aren&rsquo;t employed to enforce the law, but to enforce privilege. With zero consequences for violating the rule of law.</p>

    <p>The GOP-controlled House Intelligence Committee can&rsquo;t bring itself to commit to its farcical obsession with Benghazi:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The House Intelligence Committee report was released with little fanfare on the Friday before Thanksgiving week. Many of its findings echo those of six previous investigations by various congressional committees and a State Department panel.</p>

<p>And yet they keep on beating on that conspiracy theory door:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The eighth Benghazi investigation is being carried out by a House Select Committee appointed in May.</p>

<p>At this point, it&rsquo;s more likely that President Obama is a space lizard bringing communism to America. This insidious charade won&rsquo;t end until a sufficiently radical republican is in the Oval Office.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m overjoyed to announce that Noël and I are engaged! Though we are less traditional in most things, we also both appreciate the ritual of proposing, and have the honor of carrying on a cherished family heirloom: her great-great grandmother&rsquo;s engagement ring, which has been in her family for over a century. I can&rsquo;t wait to carry on its legacy for many years to come.</p>

    <p>Jason Snell is making the iPad Air 2 all the more tempting:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The iPad Air 2 has twice as much RAM of any previous iOS device. And while the effects are subtle, they&rsquo;re profound. Safari tabs just stay loaded most of the time. Apps that you used recently-ish snap open immediately rather than doing a bunch of housekeeping. Switching directly between apps feels vastly better, because it&rsquo;s all instantaneous. More RAM lets the entire system breathe.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I might break cycle and get the hypothetical iPhone 6s if it includes 2GB of RAM, too. The improvement is a paradigm shift in how responsive the device feels.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s interesting how niche industries dominated by a few giant companies seem to always start off with the most altruistic goals. That Google is behind the helm of this company isn&rsquo;t surprising — they&rsquo;re even repurposing the &ldquo;don&rsquo;t be evil&rdquo; rhetoric.</p>

    <p>Way back when I was in high school, all of my schoolwork fell into a similar pattern: I would be either monumentally enthusiastic or apprehensive towards every assignment. I&rsquo;d dive head first into a project, or freeze at the sight of 80 whole pages of reading a night.<sup id="fnref1-the-architect-got-left-behind"><a href="#fn1-the-architect-got-left-behind">1</a></sup></p>

<p>I was fortunate enough to attend a school that <a href="http://pscs.org/about-pscs/">encourages personal growth and self reflection</a>, and so I learned to structure my work and channel my enthusiasm into productivity. It is a continuing process, but I like to think that I correct myself earlier as I practice more.</p>

<p>This diversion is an explanation. Though I am extremely excited to get Tsunami off the ground, I jumped into prototyping without considering the structure of the app. In plowing forward along the critical path, I boxed myself into a monolithic app which would make future improvements difficult at best.</p>

<p>Keeping this in mind, I&rsquo;m going to be blogging more about the <em>structure</em> of Tsunami, and developing a set of meta-goals for the project to guide future development. Expect more soon!</p>

    <p>While national-level politics turned out <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=2014+election+results&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;client=safari">abysmally</a>, there&rsquo;s some good news for my local friends:</p>

<ul>
<li>Initiative 591 (outlawing further gun regulations): <strong>NO 68%</strong></li>
<li>Initiative 594 (closing gun show loopholes): <strong>YES 75%</strong></li>
<li>Seattle Proposition 1 (expanding transportation funding): <strong>YES 59%</strong></li>
<li>Seattle Proposition 1B (universal preschool): <strong>YES 67%</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>So, while the nation must face the demagogues wresting control of both houses of congress, our little corner of the country will have an improving transportation system (lord knows we need it), will care for children in need, and provide basic checks for gun sales.</p>

    <h4>**Sometimes, it&#39;s best to just start *somewhere***</h4>

<p>A project has been percolating on my back burner for a long while. My friend <a href="http://twitter.com/ericjusino">Eric</a> came to me with an idea for a truly decentralized social network: a protocol similar to email in spirit but more akin to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent">BitTorrent</a> in implementation. Obviously, discoverability is a challenge in any social network, and one without a central directory harder still. </p>

<p>Oh yeah, and it has to be both secure and anonymous while in plain sight. </p>

<p>This is obviously a massive project to bite off, and I want to eventually release this protocol into the open source world and see what direction it takes (it&#39;s only appropriate that such a cooperative network should be built *by* the community). I&#39;m going to be using this blog as a journal of my progress and as a way to &ldquo;<a href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging">think out loud</a>&rdquo; about making this. There&#39;ll be occasional opinion posts on here, but I want to focus on the project. </p>

<p>Given the scope of this, I&#39;m just going to start building the basic structure I&#39;m looking for so I can begin iterating on the protocol as soon as possible. As this project needs a name (and our joke one of &ldquo;GitFace&rdquo; seems a bit rough), I&#39;m going to go ahead and name it Tsunami. It&#39;s a Japanese word (yay, heritage!), and is reminiscent of how messages propagate through the network, making minimal waves before reaching their destination. </p>

<p>Today I was hammering-out a basic format for Tsunami messages. To test the network implementation (which I will probably the next post) as soon as possible, I&#39;m just doing a basic JSON structure:</p>

<pre>{
    &quot;kind&quot;: &quot;tsunami:alpha&quot;,
    &quot;id&quot;: &quot;sha512 hex digest&quot;,
    &quot;payload&quot;: {
        &quot;metadata&quot;: {
            &quot;title&quot;: &quot;my first title&quot;,
            &quot;verification&quot;: &quot;should decrypt to same as message id&quot;
        },
        &quot;body&quot;: &quot;payload encrypted using public key encryption. Public key is functionally the to: field&quot;
    }
}</pre>

<p>My good friend <a href="http://twitter.com/russellhay">Russell</a> suggested a binary format to save space and prevent the need to parse out many messages; streamlining this process will result in a huge amount of saved time given how frequently these messages are going to be whizzing to and fro. I&#39;m designing the server so that different message formats can be interchanged without affecting the remaining code. The current version is part of the document string, so changing implementations (such as modifying the encryption or hashing algorithms) can be propagated and declared properly.</p>

<p>I want this format to be relatively generic — not just a messaging platform, but for syndication, mailing lists, etc. **Keeping the protocol flexible is a primary concern.**</p>

        <div class="post-meta">Tue, Oct 21, 2014</div>
    </div>

    <p>Consumption of online media has changed significantly with the increasing popularity of Twitter, Facebook, and other social networks. We&rsquo;re exposed to interesting pieces all day, but it&rsquo;s not always the best time to sit down and read them. A common &ldquo;solution&rdquo; for most people is to repost the link to their friends; this is a half solution to their problem, at best. Social networks are not designed to be curators of users&rsquo; content: they are meant to hawk ever-newer wares to their followers, and any ability to find old content is incidental at best. Twitter&rsquo;s and Facebook&rsquo;s search capabilities are limited at best, and sifting out the &ldquo;read later&rdquo; links from everything else in the haystack of posts is not efficient. Luckily, this is a problem that many services address: organizing, saving, and presenting reading material in an easy-to-use way.</p>

<p>I can only assume that the behavior of &ldquo;posting so I can find it later&rdquo; is because of the ubiquity of social media—it&rsquo;s relatively easy to remember that we put a random article on underwater basketweaving on Facebook, but digging it up can be a pain. Posting on social media is also an implicit endorsement of a link&rsquo;s merit, sharing it with our followers for their benefit. The primary point of posting on Facebook or Twitter is to share with your friends. Not only is it hard to retrieve the links you &ldquo;save&rdquo; on your public timeline, but it inundates your followers with personal cruft that they will find irrelevant.</p>

<p>Another behavior is leaving a sea of open tabs, orphaned until the deluge is too much to handle. The reason that these pages will never be given attention—even more so with runaway bookmarks buried eight layers deep in menus—is that they are being stored in the wrong context. Do you sit down in front of your computer because you want to catch up on long form reading? That is precisely not what I use my computer for. It is a tool for sifting through data, writing, and some web surfing, not flicking a scroll wheel for an hour. Being able to read in a relaxed position at a time of your choosing is invaluable.</p>

<p>There are a many great apps out there to help with organizing your reading material. Pocket is a great start: it&rsquo;s free, has some necessary features (primarily offline storage), and will display more readable text than most web pages. I personally like Instapaper: it offers a more minimalist interface, with finer control over text display, more apps that save to it, at a cost of $4. I&rsquo;ve found that Pocket&rsquo;s web scraper will often miss chunks of content that I want, and I love having so much control over how Instapaper behaves.</p>

<p>If you just need to organize your links without offline reading, Pinboard might fit your needs better. Pinboard emphasizes privacy and speed. They are a pay-for service—a one-time ~$10—and as a result refuse to sell their users&rsquo; information to advertisers. If you&rsquo;re concerned about privacy, this business model will be very appealing to you. Remember: if you aren&rsquo;t paying for a service, you are the product, not the customer. Though there&rsquo;s no official app, Pinner on iOS is a great client. Saving to Pinboard—like Instapaper and Pocket—is done via bookmarklet or in built into other apps like Twitterrific and Feedly. Organization is done with tags, and full text search is available with the $25 a year Archival account. Pinboard can also be used to share links with friends (like Delicious) and for reading articles offline with the Archival account, as well.</p>

<p>Though it might appear easier to cram link saving into Facebook or your bookmarks bar, it is unsustainable, especially if you read a lot of articles. Instapaper has encouraged me to read more by making it easy and fun, and hopefully these apps will help you, too.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s an everyday war.</p>

<p>—Stephane Vigroux, Parkour Generations</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As traceurs, we strive to overcome obstacles as efficiently as possible. For a time, in the beginning, the going is easy. Sure we&#8217;ll end up sore every night after we train, but it is easy in the moment to push ourselves to do better. All of the basic movements in parkour can be learned in a matter of months, and most of us are self-selected to be kinesthetically intelligent. This is the honeymoon stage in our relationship with the discipline—where we build new skills every day—still feeling out how it&rsquo;s gonna be between us.</p>

<p>Once we have gained proficiency with those skills, however, a new leg of the journey begins. Kevin Carroll calls this &#8220;the lonely work&#8221;, the work that nobody knows about, but also the work that really makes a difference. To do anything well, you need to have that dedication and passion to train, by your own motivation.</p>

<p>In order to shine in all moments you must prepare. You must do your homework. Preparation means doing what I call the lonely work: the unglamorous tasks that no one tells you to do and the hard work that no one will notice.</p>

<p>—Kevin Carroll, <a href="http://smile.amazon.com/Rules-Red-Rubber-Ball-Sustain/dp/1933060026/ref=smi_www_rco2_go_smi?_encoding=UTF8&*Version*=1&*entries*=0"><em>Rules of the Red Rubber Ball</em></a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>As practitioners of our art we must devote untold hours honing our craft. Doing the lonely work requires a certain mental fortitude to challenge yourself, every day. You train parkour, progressing forward and avoiding stagnation at all costs. To be successful requires commitment, persistence, and patience. Nobody accomplished anything that was easy, and all of the experienced traceurs that we look up to truly dedicated themselves to parkour.</p>

<p>When coaching parkour, we emphasize that this isn&#8217;t meant to be practiced once a week and called good. With this discipline you need to take pride in your work, going that extra mile between mediocre and excellent. I truly believe that an extra 30 minutes a day of training is what makes the difference, over time, between Daniel Ilabaca and the half-assers.</p>

<p>Train hard, train safe, and most importantly train well.</p>

    <p>Only a few decades ago, our social lives were an intimate tapestry woven amongst our friends. Our friends knew everything about us, and we were the same for them. News was actively shared with the people we cared about most; we could keep track of who knew what with a fair amount of accuracy, and the art of conversation was alive and well. We told stories, we mailed newsletters to relatives, we laughed together over a beer.</p>

<p>Personal interactions have given way to indirect communication blasts. Now most of our lives are announced into a void, where individual significance is lost in a sea of status updates. Many lament this loss of intimacy, but there is a more significant change with the coming of the social web.</p>

<p>Privacy has become more of a concern as the older generations begin to adopt social networks such as Facebook and Twitter. The concept of being &ldquo;Googled&rdquo; is frightening in the context of tangible privacy, but is commonly accepted as a fact of life on the internet. It has become nearly impossible to avoid the internet&rsquo;s grasp in the age of Facebook and Google. The currency on the net is information: anything and everything that a company can get their hands on.</p>

<p>The definition of &ldquo;personal information&rdquo; has undergone a massive change in the internet revolution&rsquo;s wake. It is practically impossible to avoid divulging your personal activities to massive net corporations, especially as their techniques are becoming more sophisticated. As an example, anytime you visit a page with Facebook&rsquo;s ubiquitous &ldquo;like&rdquo; button, they now have your activity recorded and are able to <a href="http://www.geek.com/articles/news/facebook-like-button-tracks-you-even-if-you-dont-click-20110519/">track you throughout the net.</a></p>

<p>Personal information is the new currency of the internet. Advertisers want it, and are willing to pay for our services for us if we provide them with a little bit of data. Facebook is making billions of dollars off of advertising, I doubt its users would like to foot the bill. Even as America&rsquo;s economy switches from manufacturing where tangible goods are bought and sold to one where services are exchanged, consumers are unable to wrap their heads around paying for these fantastic services. This is a subject for an entirely separate blog post, but the feeling of &ldquo;free&rdquo; that we get when we pay with our habits instead of our wallets is feeding this delusion.</p>

<p>Perhaps due to &ldquo;growing up with the internet&rdquo;, I don&rsquo;t really care as much about traditional &ldquo;privacy&rdquo; anyway. Yes, I do take my online identity seriously. Yes, I realize that publicly tweeting about being away from home <a href="http://www.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,1964873,00.html">isn&rsquo;t a great idea</a>. Do I guard my real name as if my life depended on it? No!</p>

<p>I believe that living with Integrity in all aspects of life is important, and the internet is no exception. We all walk the line of what to show on our sleeve, but I think I fall further on the side of candor than most. I do avoid placing my family and acquaintances in the line of fire of my personal life, but I&rsquo;m not going to hide it from them either. If they go on a fishing expedition they can take responsibility for what they catch.</p>
