    <blockquote>
<p>But the point of a trial would have been to try to answer these questions. We would have either found out if everything we thought we knew about Brown was wrong, or if Wilson’s story was flawed in important ways. But now we’re not going to get that chance. We’re just left with Wilson’s unbelievable story.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is why we have trials. The prosecutor threw the indictment. There&rsquo;s an abundance of doubt surrounding this incident, which is the burden of proof for indictment.</p>

The average black person, on the other hand, has 83 black friends, eight white friends, two Latino friends, zero Asian friends, three mixed race friends, one other race friend and four friends of unknown race.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&ldquo;Colorblind&rdquo;, eh? There are many possible explanations for this phenomenon, but it&rsquo;d be impossible to conclude that the average white person has any clue about racism in America—they hardly know anyone whom experiences it!</p>

    <blockquote>
<p>Those of us who are white have a remarkable capacity for delusions. A majority of whites have said in opinion polls that blacks earn as much as whites and are as healthy as whites. In fact, black median household income is $34,598, compared with $58,270 for non-Hispanic whites, according to census data. Black life expectancy is four years shorter than that of whites.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&rsquo;s handy to be able to say you&rsquo;re &ldquo;tired of&rdquo; talking about oppression. Imagine living with it every day.</p>

    <blockquote>
<p>That’s what this anger is about. That this non-indictment exposed the gaping race chasm in America: white people love police and authority when it comes to maintaining the social order. That social order is fairly simple: there are the whites who can do whatever they want, then there are the “criminals” and the “minorities” and the “gays”, except those that act like the white people. The system exists to contain the teeming masses of minorities/criminals and to keep them in check. If a black man is killed by a police officer, well that’s his fault.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Gideon goes on to describe the police as a &ldquo;private security force&rdquo;. He couldn&rsquo;t be more accurate. With this case it is ever more obvious that they aren&rsquo;t employed to enforce the law, but to enforce privilege. With zero consequences for violating the rule of law.</p>

    <p>The GOP-controlled House Intelligence Committee can&rsquo;t bring itself to commit to its farcical obsession with Benghazi:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The House Intelligence Committee report was released with little fanfare on the Friday before Thanksgiving week. Many of its findings echo those of six previous investigations by various congressional committees and a State Department panel.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And yet they keep on beating on that conspiracy theory door:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The eighth Benghazi investigation is being carried out by a House Select Committee appointed in May.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At this point, it&rsquo;s more likely that President Obama is a space lizard bringing communism to America. This insidious charade won&rsquo;t end until a sufficiently radical republican is in the Oval Office.</p>

<p>I know this is a blunt response. I don’t have time to engage one-on-one with the armies of concern trolls spreading false equivalences and wasting time and emotional energy of the rest of the community. You may know them as the “Christian, dad, husband, programmer”s of the Internet. The people who think they are being victimized because they once heard that someone lost their job after being an asshole on the Internet, and feeling scared of and persecuted by this, without realizing that the position they enjoy in this industry is hugely propped up by financial and technical institutions built upon legacies of sexism, racism, and inequity - because it was (and remains) profitable.</p>

<p>No comment necessary. The toxic culture in tech (and especially online tech communities) <strong>demands</strong> preemptive measures to protect the greater community.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m overjoyed to announce that Noël and I are engaged! Though we are less traditional in most things, we also both appreciate the ritual of proposing, and have the honor of carrying on a cherished family heirloom: her great-great grandmother&rsquo;s engagement ring, which has been in her family for over a century. I can&rsquo;t wait to carry on its legacy for many years to come.</p>
