            <description>&lt;p&gt;Cross-platform clipboard management is a tough problem to solve. &lt;a href=&#34;http://heapo.marblzz.com/&#34;&gt;Mohammad Khoman&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://appsto.re/us/Eka92.i&#34;&gt;Heapo&lt;/a&gt; has the right features — a today view widget, sync between iOS, Windows, and Mac, ad-free interface — all in a free app. As users of &lt;a href=&#34;http://tapbots.com&#34;&gt;Tapbot&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a&gt; venerable &lt;a href=&#34;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id344614116?mt=8&#34;&gt;Pastebot&lt;/a&gt; know, being able to quickly save clipboard contents for later&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:324c3bd4e1c202ab120c3f6668339c62:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:324c3bd4e1c202ab120c3f6668339c62:1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; is incredibly useful: especially when it&amp;rsquo;s a swipe away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I highly recommend giving Heapo a try.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m overjoyed to announce that Noël and I are engaged! Though we are less traditional in most things, we also both appreciate the ritual of proposing, and have the honor of carrying on a cherished family heirloom: her great-great grandmother&amp;rsquo;s engagement ring, which has been in her family for over a century. I can&amp;rsquo;t wait to carry on its legacy for many years to come.&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;Consumption of online media has changed significantly with the increasing popularity of Twitter, Facebook, and other social networks. We&amp;rsquo;re exposed to interesting pieces all day, but it&amp;rsquo;s not always the best time to sit down and read them. A common &amp;ldquo;solution&amp;rdquo; for most people is to repost the link to their friends; this is a half solution to their problem, at best. Social networks are not designed to be curators of users&amp;rsquo; content: they are meant to hawk ever-newer wares to their followers, and any ability to find old content is incidental at best. Twitter&amp;rsquo;s and Facebook&amp;rsquo;s search capabilities are limited at best, and sifting out the &amp;ldquo;read later&amp;rdquo; links from everything else in the haystack of posts is not efficient. Luckily, this is a problem that many services address: organizing, saving, and presenting reading material in an easy-to-use way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can only assume that the behavior of &amp;ldquo;posting so I can find it later&amp;rdquo; is because of the ubiquity of social media—it&amp;rsquo;s relatively easy to remember that we put a random article on underwater basketweaving on Facebook, but digging it up can be a pain. Posting on social media is also an implicit endorsement of a link&amp;rsquo;s merit, sharing it with our followers for their benefit. The primary point of posting on Facebook or Twitter is to share with your friends. Not only is it hard to retrieve the links you &amp;ldquo;save&amp;rdquo; on your public timeline, but it inundates your followers with personal cruft that they will find irrelevant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another behavior is leaving a sea of open tabs, orphaned until the deluge is too much to handle. The reason that these pages will never be given attention—even more so with runaway bookmarks buried eight layers deep in menus—is that they are being stored in the wrong context. Do you sit down in front of your computer because you want to catch up on long form reading? That is precisely not what I use my computer for. It is a tool for sifting through data, writing, and some web surfing, not flicking a scroll wheel for an hour. Being able to read in a relaxed position at a time of your choosing is invaluable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a many great apps out there to help with organizing your reading material. Pocket is a great start: it&amp;rsquo;s free, has some necessary features (primarily offline storage), and will display more readable text than most web pages. I personally like Instapaper: it offers a more minimalist interface, with finer control over text display, more apps that save to it, at a cost of $4. I&amp;rsquo;ve found that Pocket&amp;rsquo;s web scraper will often miss chunks of content that I want, and I love having so much control over how Instapaper behaves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you just need to organize your links without offline reading, Pinboard might fit your needs better. Pinboard emphasizes privacy and speed. They are a pay-for service—a one-time ~$10—and as a result refuse to sell their users&amp;rsquo; information to advertisers. If you&amp;rsquo;re concerned about privacy, this business model will be very appealing to you. Remember: if you aren&amp;rsquo;t paying for a service, you are the product, not the customer. Though there&amp;rsquo;s no official app, Pinner on iOS is a great client. Saving to Pinboard—like Instapaper and Pocket—is done via bookmarklet or in built into other apps like Twitterrific and Feedly. Organization is done with tags, and full text search is available with the $25 a year Archival account. Pinboard can also be used to share links with friends (like Delicious) and for reading articles offline with the Archival account, as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though it might appear easier to cram link saving into Facebook or your bookmarks bar, it is unsustainable, especially if you read a lot of articles. Instapaper has encouraged me to read more by making it easy and fun, and hopefully these apps will help you, too.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>the lonely work</title>
            <link>http://kellenfujimoto.com/blog/2012/11/the-lonely-work/</link>
            <pubDate>Wed, 07 Nov 2012 22:49:07 PST</pubDate>

            <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s an everyday war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;—Stephane Vigroux, Parkour Generations&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As traceurs, we strive to overcome obstacles as efficiently as possible. For a time, in the beginning, the going is easy. Sure we&amp;#8217;ll end up sore every night after we train, but it is easy in the moment to push ourselves to do better. All of the basic movements in parkour can be learned in a matter of months, and most of us are self-selected to be kinesthetically intelligent. This is the honeymoon stage in our relationship with the discipline—where we build new skills every day—still feeling out how it&amp;rsquo;s gonna be between us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once we have gained proficiency with those skills, however, a new leg of the journey begins. Kevin Carroll calls this &amp;#8220;the lonely work&amp;#8221;, the work that nobody knows about, but also the work that really makes a difference. To do anything well, you need to have that dedication and passion to train, by your own motivation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to shine in all moments you must prepare. You must do your homework. Preparation means doing what I call the lonely work: the unglamorous tasks that no one tells you to do and the hard work that no one will notice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;—Kevin Carroll, &lt;a href=&#34;http://smile.amazon.com/Rules-Red-Rubber-Ball-Sustain/dp/1933060026/ref=smi_www_rco2_go_smi?_encoding=UTF8&amp;*Version*=1&amp;*entries*=0&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rules of the Red Rubber Ball&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As practitioners of our art we must devote untold hours honing our craft. Doing the lonely work requires a certain mental fortitude to challenge yourself, every day. You train parkour, progressing forward and avoiding stagnation at all costs. To be successful requires commitment, persistence, and patience. Nobody accomplished anything that was easy, and all of the experienced traceurs that we look up to truly dedicated themselves to parkour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When coaching parkour, we emphasize that this isn&amp;#8217;t meant to be practiced once a week and called good. With this discipline you need to take pride in your work, going that extra mile between mediocre and excellent. I truly believe that an extra 30 minutes a day of training is what makes the difference, over time, between Daniel Ilabaca and the half-assers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Train hard, train safe, and most importantly train well.&lt;/p&gt;
