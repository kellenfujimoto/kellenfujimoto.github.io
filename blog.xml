            <description>&lt;p&gt;Cross-platform clipboard management is a tough problem to solve. &lt;a href=&#34;http://heapo.marblzz.com/&#34;&gt;Mohammad Khoman&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://appsto.re/us/Eka92.i&#34;&gt;Heapo&lt;/a&gt; has the right features — a today view widget, sync between iOS, Windows, and Mac, ad-free interface — all in a free app. As users of &lt;a href=&#34;http://tapbots.com&#34;&gt;Tapbot&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a&gt; venerable &lt;a href=&#34;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id344614116?mt=8&#34;&gt;Pastebot&lt;/a&gt; know, being able to quickly save clipboard contents for later&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:324c3bd4e1c202ab120c3f6668339c62:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:324c3bd4e1c202ab120c3f6668339c62:1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; is incredibly useful: especially when it&amp;rsquo;s a swipe away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I highly recommend giving Heapo a try.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m overjoyed to announce that Noël and I are engaged! Though we are less traditional in most things, we also both appreciate the ritual of proposing, and have the honor of carrying on a cherished family heirloom: her great-great grandmother&amp;rsquo;s engagement ring, which has been in her family for over a century. I can&amp;rsquo;t wait to carry on its legacy for many years to come.&lt;/p&gt;

            <description>&lt;p&gt;Consumption of online media has changed significantly with the increasing popularity of Twitter, Facebook, and other social networks. We&amp;rsquo;re exposed to interesting pieces all day, but it&amp;rsquo;s not always the best time to sit down and read them. A common &amp;ldquo;solution&amp;rdquo; for most people is to repost the link to their friends; this is a half solution to their problem, at best. Social networks are not designed to be curators of users&amp;rsquo; content: they are meant to hawk ever-newer wares to their followers, and any ability to find old content is incidental at best. Twitter&amp;rsquo;s and Facebook&amp;rsquo;s search capabilities are limited at best, and sifting out the &amp;ldquo;read later&amp;rdquo; links from everything else in the haystack of posts is not efficient. Luckily, this is a problem that many services address: organizing, saving, and presenting reading material in an easy-to-use way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can only assume that the behavior of &amp;ldquo;posting so I can find it later&amp;rdquo; is because of the ubiquity of social media—it&amp;rsquo;s relatively easy to remember that we put a random article on underwater basketweaving on Facebook, but digging it up can be a pain. Posting on social media is also an implicit endorsement of a link&amp;rsquo;s merit, sharing it with our followers for their benefit. The primary point of posting on Facebook or Twitter is to share with your friends. Not only is it hard to retrieve the links you &amp;ldquo;save&amp;rdquo; on your public timeline, but it inundates your followers with personal cruft that they will find irrelevant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another behavior is leaving a sea of open tabs, orphaned until the deluge is too much to handle. The reason that these pages will never be given attention—even more so with runaway bookmarks buried eight layers deep in menus—is that they are being stored in the wrong context. Do you sit down in front of your computer because you want to catch up on long form reading? That is precisely not what I use my computer for. It is a tool for sifting through data, writing, and some web surfing, not flicking a scroll wheel for an hour. Being able to read in a relaxed position at a time of your choosing is invaluable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a many great apps out there to help with organizing your reading material. Pocket is a great start: it&amp;rsquo;s free, has some necessary features (primarily offline storage), and will display more readable text than most web pages. I personally like Instapaper: it offers a more minimalist interface, with finer control over text display, more apps that save to it, at a cost of $4. I&amp;rsquo;ve found that Pocket&amp;rsquo;s web scraper will often miss chunks of content that I want, and I love having so much control over how Instapaper behaves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you just need to organize your links without offline reading, Pinboard might fit your needs better. Pinboard emphasizes privacy and speed. They are a pay-for service—a one-time ~$10—and as a result refuse to sell their users&amp;rsquo; information to advertisers. If you&amp;rsquo;re concerned about privacy, this business model will be very appealing to you. Remember: if you aren&amp;rsquo;t paying for a service, you are the product, not the customer. Though there&amp;rsquo;s no official app, Pinner on iOS is a great client. Saving to Pinboard—like Instapaper and Pocket—is done via bookmarklet or in built into other apps like Twitterrific and Feedly. Organization is done with tags, and full text search is available with the $25 a year Archival account. Pinboard can also be used to share links with friends (like Delicious) and for reading articles offline with the Archival account, as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though it might appear easier to cram link saving into Facebook or your bookmarks bar, it is unsustainable, especially if you read a lot of articles. Instapaper has encouraged me to read more by making it easy and fun, and hopefully these apps will help you, too.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>the lonely work</title>
            <link>http://kellenfujimoto.com/blog/2012/11/the-lonely-work/</link>
            <pubDate>Wed, 07 Nov 2012 22:49:07 PST</pubDate>

            <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s an everyday war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;—Stephane Vigroux, Parkour Generations&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As traceurs, we strive to overcome obstacles as efficiently as possible. For a time, in the beginning, the going is easy. Sure we&amp;#8217;ll end up sore every night after we train, but it is easy in the moment to push ourselves to do better. All of the basic movements in parkour can be learned in a matter of months, and most of us are self-selected to be kinesthetically intelligent. This is the honeymoon stage in our relationship with the discipline—where we build new skills every day—still feeling out how it&amp;rsquo;s gonna be between us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once we have gained proficiency with those skills, however, a new leg of the journey begins. Kevin Carroll calls this &amp;#8220;the lonely work&amp;#8221;, the work that nobody knows about, but also the work that really makes a difference. To do anything well, you need to have that dedication and passion to train, by your own motivation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to shine in all moments you must prepare. You must do your homework. Preparation means doing what I call the lonely work: the unglamorous tasks that no one tells you to do and the hard work that no one will notice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;—Kevin Carroll, &lt;a href=&#34;http://smile.amazon.com/Rules-Red-Rubber-Ball-Sustain/dp/1933060026/ref=smi_www_rco2_go_smi?_encoding=UTF8&amp;*Version*=1&amp;*entries*=0&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rules of the Red Rubber Ball&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As practitioners of our art we must devote untold hours honing our craft. Doing the lonely work requires a certain mental fortitude to challenge yourself, every day. You train parkour, progressing forward and avoiding stagnation at all costs. To be successful requires commitment, persistence, and patience. Nobody accomplished anything that was easy, and all of the experienced traceurs that we look up to truly dedicated themselves to parkour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When coaching parkour, we emphasize that this isn&amp;#8217;t meant to be practiced once a week and called good. With this discipline you need to take pride in your work, going that extra mile between mediocre and excellent. I truly believe that an extra 30 minutes a day of training is what makes the difference, over time, between Daniel Ilabaca and the half-assers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Train hard, train safe, and most importantly train well.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Thoughts on Privacy</title>
            <link>http://kellenfujimoto.com/blog/1/01/thoughts-on-privacy/</link>
            <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>
            <author>contact@kellenfujimoto.com</author>
            <guid>http://kellenfujimoto.com/blog/1/01/thoughts-on-privacy/</guid>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;Only a few decades ago, our social lives were an intimate tapestry woven amongst our friends. Our friends knew everything about us, and we were the same for them. News was actively shared with the people we cared about most; we could keep track of who knew what with a fair amount of accuracy, and the art of conversation was alive and well. We told stories, we mailed newsletters to relatives, we laughed together over a beer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personal interactions have given way to indirect communication blasts. Now most of our lives are announced into a void, where individual significance is lost in a sea of status updates. Many lament this loss of intimacy, but there is a more significant change with the coming of the social web.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Privacy has become more of a concern as the older generations begin to adopt social networks such as Facebook and Twitter. The concept of being &amp;ldquo;Googled&amp;rdquo; is frightening in the context of tangible privacy, but is commonly accepted as a fact of life on the internet. It has become nearly impossible to avoid the internet&amp;rsquo;s grasp in the age of Facebook and Google. The currency on the net is information: anything and everything that a company can get their hands on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The definition of &amp;ldquo;personal information&amp;rdquo; has undergone a massive change in the internet revolution&amp;rsquo;s wake. It is practically impossible to avoid divulging your personal activities to massive net corporations, especially as their techniques are becoming more sophisticated. As an example, anytime you visit a page with Facebook&amp;rsquo;s ubiquitous &amp;ldquo;like&amp;rdquo; button, they now have your activity recorded and are able to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.geek.com/articles/news/facebook-like-button-tracks-you-even-if-you-dont-click-20110519/&#34;&gt;track you throughout the net.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personal information is the new currency of the internet. Advertisers want it, and are willing to pay for our services for us if we provide them with a little bit of data. Facebook is making billions of dollars off of advertising, I doubt its users would like to foot the bill. Even as America&amp;rsquo;s economy switches from manufacturing where tangible goods are bought and sold to one where services are exchanged, consumers are unable to wrap their heads around paying for these fantastic services. This is a subject for an entirely separate blog post, but the feeling of &amp;ldquo;free&amp;rdquo; that we get when we pay with our habits instead of our wallets is feeding this delusion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps due to &amp;ldquo;growing up with the internet&amp;rdquo;, I don&amp;rsquo;t really care as much about traditional &amp;ldquo;privacy&amp;rdquo; anyway. Yes, I do take my online identity seriously. Yes, I realize that publicly tweeting about being away from home &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,1964873,00.html&#34;&gt;isn&amp;rsquo;t a great idea&lt;/a&gt;. Do I guard my real name as if my life depended on it? No!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe that living with Integrity in all aspects of life is important, and the internet is no exception. We all walk the line of what to show on our sleeve, but I think I fall further on the side of candor than most. I do avoid placing my family and acquaintances in the line of fire of my personal life, but I&amp;rsquo;m not going to hide it from them either. If they go on a fishing expedition they can take responsibility for what they catch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even as people become more aware of how little privacy there is on the net, companies are getting more clever about hiding their data mining. In the end, our information is a commodity no different from cash or labor, and if you aren&amp;rsquo;t paying in one, you&amp;rsquo;re certainly paying in another.&lt;/p&gt;
